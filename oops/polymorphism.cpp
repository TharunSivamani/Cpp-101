Polymorphism
Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

For example, imagine a base class Animal with a method called makeSound(). Derived classes of Animals could be Pigs, Cats, Dogs, Birds, etc. Every animal can "make a sound", but each one sounds different:

Pig: wee wee
Dog: bow wow
Bird: tweet tweet
This is polymorphism - the same action (making a sound) behaves differently for each animal:

*/

class Animal{
    public:
        void animalSound(){
            cout << "Animal Sound. " << endl;
        }
};

class Cat: public Animal{
    public:
        void animalSound(){
            cout << "Cat - Meowww." << endl;
        }
};

class Dog : public Animal{
    public:
        void animalSound(){
            cout << "Dog - Barkkk." << endl;
        }
};

int main()
{

    Animal myAnimal;
    Cat myCat;
    Dog myDog;

    myAnimal.animalSound();
    myCat.animalSound();
    myDog.animalSound();
    return 0;
}
